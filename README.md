# FOR 2715 - Epileptogenesis of genetic epilepsies

Epilepsy is a common and disabling condition with a significant disease burden worldwide. Gene discovery and functional analyses of genetic defects have been major drivers to unravel disease mechanisms and to bring about first personalized treatments. However, most of the genetic alterations underlying epilepsy remain to be elucidated. Genetic epilepsies show a typical age dependency, the origin of which is largely unknown. Therefore, developmental factors are likely to play a pivotal role for epileptogenesis of genetic epilepsies. In this Research Unit (RU), we aim to investigate if and how genetic mutations induce a cascade of multidimensional epileptogenic processes, and how these interact with developmental processes which likely contribute to the age-dependent manifestation of seizure phenotypes in genetic epilepsies.
